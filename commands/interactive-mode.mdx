The `bugster` shell provides a persistent, interactive environment for running tests and commands. Type natural language to test instantly, browse commands with `/`, and navigate files with `@`.

## Quick Start

```bash
bugster
```

<Card title="/" icon="terminal">
**Command Browser**

Type `/` to browse and autocomplete all Bugster commands
</Card>

<Card title="@" icon="folder">
**File Navigator**

Type `@` to interactively select test or source files
</Card>

<Card title="Natural Text" icon="message">
**Inline Tests**

Type 5+ words to instantly run a test
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Start shell
bugster

# Browse and run command
/generate --page @

# Quick inline test (5+ words required)
test login form with invalid email addresses

# Run specific test file
/run @

# Exit
/exit
```

## Key Features

- **No `bugster` prefix needed** - Direct command execution
- **Command history** - Use ↑/↓ arrows to navigate previous commands
- **Smart file filtering** - `/run @` shows only tests, `/generate --page @` excludes tests
- **Persistent session** - Stay in context across multiple operations
- **Instant execution** - Natural language (5+ words) runs tests immediately

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Command browser |
| `@` | File browser |
| `↑` `↓` | Navigate history/items |
| `Enter` | Execute/Select |
| `Ctrl+C` × 2 | Exit shell |

## Common Commands

```bash
/generate              # Generate tests
/run                   # Run all tests
/run --fast           # Run tests in fast mode
/update               # Update test specs
/validate             # Validate config
```

<Tip>
Use the shell for active development sessions. It's faster than one-off commands and maintains your workflow context.

<Warning>
Inline tests require **at least 5 words**. Shorter phrases won't execute as tests.
