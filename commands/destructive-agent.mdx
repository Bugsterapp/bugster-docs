The `bugster destructive` command runs AI-powered destructive agents to find potential bugs by simulating edge cases, unexpected user behavior, and malicious inputs that could break your application.

## Basic Usage

```bash
bugster destructive
```

## Command Overview

Executes specialized AI agents designed to stress-test your application by attempting to break it through aggressive interactions, malicious inputs, and edge case scenarios.

### When to Use

- **Before major releases** to catch edge case bugs
- On staging environments to stress-test changes
- After significant code modifications
- When you want to find vulnerabilities proactively

### Key Features

- AI agents simulate malicious and edge case user behavior
- Only targets pages with recent code changes (git diff)
- Records videos of destructive attempts for debugging
- Multiple specialized agent types with different attack vectors
- More aggressive than regular testing approaches

<Warning>
**NEVER run against production environments.** Destructive agents can cause data corruption, submit forms, delete data, or trigger irreversible actions. Use only on test/staging environments.
</Warning>

## Command Syntax

```bash
bugster destructive [options]
```

## How It Works

The destructive command:

1. **Change Detection**: Identifies pages with recent code changes using git diff
2. **Agent Selection**: Deploys specialized destructive agents based on page types
3. **Aggressive Testing**: Agents attempt to break functionality through various methods
4. **Result Recording**: Captures videos and logs of all destructive attempts
5. **Bug Analysis**: Reports potential vulnerabilities and edge case failures

## Agent Types

<Tabs>
<Tab title="UI Crashers">
**Priority**: Highest

Attempts to crash UI components through:
- Rapid clicking and interaction spam
- Invalid input combinations
- Boundary value testing
- Component state corruption
</Tab>

<Tab title="Form Destroyer">
**Priority**: High

Targets forms with malicious inputs:
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS payload testing
- Buffer overflow attempts
- Invalid data type submissions
</Tab>

## Execution Options

<ParamField query="--headless" type="boolean">
Run agents in headless mode without visible browser UI. Recommended for CI/CD environments.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="--parallel" type="integer" default="3">
Maximum number of concurrent agents to run simultaneously. Higher values increase testing speed but use more resources.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="--max-concurrent" type="integer" default="3">
Alias for `--parallel`. Specifies the maximum number of agents to run concurrently.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="--limit" type="integer" default="5">
Maximum number of destructive agents to execute. Range: 1-30. Higher values increase bug discovery chances.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="--browser" type="string" default="chromium">
Browser engine to use for destructive testing. Supports chromium, firefox, and webkit.
</ParamField>

## Output Options

<ParamField query="--stream-results" type="boolean" default="true">
Stream real-time results to the Bugster dashboard as agents complete their destruction attempts.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="--no-stream-results" type="boolean">
Disable streaming to dashboard. Results will only be available locally.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="--base-url" type="string">
Override the base URL from configuration. Essential for testing staging environments.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="--verbose" type="boolean">
Enable detailed logging of agent execution and attack patterns.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="--silent" type="boolean">
Run agents silently with minimal output. Reduces noise in automated environments.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Complete Destructive Testing

```bash
bugster destructive
```

Runs all available destructive agents on pages with recent changes.

### Pre-release Validation

```bash
bugster destructive --limit 15 --parallel 5
```

Comprehensive destructive testing with maximum coverage before major releases.

### Quick Vulnerability Scan

```bash
bugster destructive --limit 3 --headless
```

Fast security and stability check with minimal resource usage.

### Staging Environment Testing

```bash
bugster destructive --base-url https://staging.myapp.com --limit 10
```

Test staging environment with comprehensive destructive scenarios.

### CI/CD Integration

```bash
bugster destructive --headless --stream-results --silent
```

Automated destructive testing optimized for continuous integration pipelines.

## Safety Guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Environment Safety">
- **Never run against production environments**
- Use dedicated test databases and isolated environments
- Ensure all data is disposable or properly backed up
- Test on staging environments that mirror production
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data Protection">
- Agents may submit forms with test data
- Potential for data deletion or corruption
- May trigger irreversible actions
- Always use test credentials and mock data
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Video Evidence">
- All destructive attempts are automatically recorded
- Videos help understand what caused detected issues
- Review recordings to learn about attack patterns
- Use videos for security team analysis
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Result Analysis

After execution, you'll receive:

- **Vulnerability Reports**: Detailed analysis of potential security issues
- **Edge Case Failures**: Documentation of unexpected behavior patterns
- **Video Recordings**: Visual evidence of successful attacks or crashes
- **Agent Logs**: Detailed execution traces for debugging
- **Severity Ratings**: Prioritized list of discovered issues

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Run destructive agents after `bugster update` to test newly modified pages. Higher `--limit` values increase the chance of finding edge case bugs, and videos are automatically saved for any issues found.
</Tip>

<Note>
Destructive testing is most effective as a final validation step before releases. Combine with regular testing for comprehensive coverage, and always review video recordings to understand root causes.
