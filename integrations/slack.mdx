<Note>
  Slack integration is optional but recommended for receiving Bugster run tests notifications. You must be a workspace admin or have permission to install apps.
</Note>

Bugster uses a Slack App to send messages to your workspace when run tests are completed. You can choose between receive all tests executions or just when errors occur.

## **Installing the Slack App**

Install the Buster Slack App through your [**dashboard**](https://app.bugster.dev/).

  </Step>
