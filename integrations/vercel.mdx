## Overview

Bugster's Vercel integration provides automated testing on every preview deployment, helping you catch bugs before they reach production. Here's how it works:

1. **Deploy Trigger**: When you push changes to a branch or create a pull request, Vercel automatically creates a preview deployment
2. **Bugster Activation**: Once the Vercel deployment is complete, Bugster detects the new preview URL
3. **Automated Testing**: Bugster runs your test suite and destructive agents against the preview deployment
4. **Results & Feedback**: Test results are reported back, allowing you to identify and fix issues before merging

This integration ensures that every code change is thoroughly tested in a real deployment environment, preventing bugs from reaching your main branch and production.

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
You must have the [Bugster GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/bugster-dev) installed and connected to your repository before using this integration.
</Warning>

Visit your [Bugster Dashboard](https://app.bugster.dev) → Project Settings → GitHub Integration to install the GitHub App if you haven't already.

### Key Benefits

- **Early Bug Detection**: Catch issues in preview deployments before they affect users
- **Automated Workflow**: No manual intervention needed - tests run automatically on every deployment
- **Real Environment Testing**: Tests run against actual deployed code, not just local development
- **Pull Request Integration**: Get test results directly in your PR workflow
- **Destructive Testing**: Advanced AI agents explore your app to find edge cases and potential issues

## Protection Bypass for Automation

Bugster requires access to your Vercel preview deployments to run automated tests. To enable this, you need to create a "Protection Bypass for Automation" secret in Vercel and add it to your Bugster configuration.

### Creating a Protection Bypass Secret

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Project Settings">
    1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
    2. Select your project
    3. Navigate to **Settings** → **Deployment Protection**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate Protection Bypass for Automation Secret">
    1. Scroll down to **Protection Bypass for Automation**
    2. Click **Create Secret** or **Regenerate** if one exists
    3. Copy the generated secret (it looks like: `vercel_bypass_1a2b3c4d5e6f...`)
    
    <Warning>
      Store this secret securely - it allows automated tools to access your preview deployments
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Bugster">
    Add the bypass secret to your Bugster configuration:
    
    **During initialization:**
    ```bash
    bugster init --bypass-protection "vercel_bypass_1a2b3c4d5e6f..." --platform vercel
    ```
    
    **Or manually in `.bugster/config.yaml`:**
    ```yaml
    project_name: "My App"
    project_id: "my-app-123456" 
    base_url: "http://localhost:3000"
    x-vercel-protection-bypass: "vercel_bypass_1a2b3c4d5e6f..."
    credentials:
      - id: "admin"
        username: "test@example.com"
        password: "testpass"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How the Bypass Works

When Bugster runs tests on your Vercel preview deployments:

1. **Header Injection**: Bugster automatically includes the `x-vercel-protection-bypass` header with your secret
2. **Access Granted**: Vercel recognizes the valid bypass secret and allows automated access to preview deployments
3. **Test Execution**: Bugster can now run tests normally on the preview deployment
4. **Automation Enabled**: This enables seamless CI/CD integration without manual intervention

### Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Secret Management" icon="key">
    - **Never commit** the bypass secret to your repository
    - **Regenerate periodically** for enhanced security
    - **Limit access** to team members who need it
    - **Monitor usage** in Vercel's deployment logs
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Environment Separation" icon="shield">
    - Use different secrets for different environments (staging, preview)
    - Consider separate Vercel projects for sensitive applications
    - Review team access permissions regularly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Secret Rotation" icon="refresh">
    - Regenerate secrets when team members leave
    - Update Bugster configuration after regeneration
    - Test the new secret with a sample deployment
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bypass Secret Not Working">
    **Symptoms**: Tests fail to access preview URLs
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the secret is correctly copied (no extra spaces)
    - Ensure the secret is properly configured in `.bugster/config.yaml`
    - Check that password protection is **disabled** in Vercel
    - Try regenerating the Protection Bypass for Automation secret in Vercel dashboard
    - Verify the secret is for "Protection Bypass for Automation" (not password protection)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tests Not Running on Preview">
    **Symptoms**: Bugster doesn't detect new deployments
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify Vercel integration is properly configured
    - Check webhook settings in Vercel project
    - Ensure your branch triggers preview deployments
    - Review Bugster project configuration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication Issues">
    **Symptoms**: Tests fail on app login despite valid credentials
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify credentials work on the preview URL manually
    - Check if preview environment uses different authentication
    - Ensure database/auth services are accessible from preview
    - Review environment variables in Vercel deployment
