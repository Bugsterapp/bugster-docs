description: 'Integrate Bugster with any deployment platform using our webhook API'
icon: "cubes"
---

Create a custom integration with Bugster to run tests on your preferred deployment infrastructure. Perfect for teams using platforms not covered by our built-in integrations.

## Overview

The custom integration uses Bugster's webhook API to trigger test runs when your deployments are ready. This approach gives you full control over when and how Bugster tests are executed in your deployment pipeline.

<Tip>
The custom integration is the same API that powers our GitHub Actions integration behind the scenes.
</Tip>

## API Endpoint

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.bugster.app/webhooks/integrations/custom' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
You must have the [Bugster GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/bugster-dev) installed and connected to your repository before using this integration.
</Warning>

Visit your [Bugster Dashboard](https://app.bugster.dev) → Project Settings → GitHub Integration to install the GitHub App if you haven't already.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Get your credentials">
Navigate to your Bugster dashboard and collect:
- **API Key**: Settings > API Keys
- **Project ID**: Project Settings > General  
- **Organization ID**: Settings > Organization

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure. Never commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Add webhook to your deployment pipeline">
Add the API call to your deployment script or CI/CD pipeline. The webhook should be called **after** your deployment succeeds and your application is accessible.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Shell Script
#!/bin/bash
# After successful deployment
curl -X POST 'https://api.bugster.app/webhooks/integrations/custom' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-KEY: $BUGSTER_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "deployment_state": "success",
    "project_id": "'$PROJECT_ID'",
    "organization_id": "'$ORG_ID'",
    "branch": "'$GIT_BRANCH'",
    "environment_url": "'$DEPLOYMENT_URL'"
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://api.bugster.app/webhooks/integrations/custom', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-API-KEY': process.env.BUGSTER_API_KEY
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    deployment_state: 'success',
    project_id: process.env.PROJECT_ID,
    organization_id: process.env.ORG_ID,
    commit_sha: process.env.GIT_COMMIT,
    environment_url: process.env.DEPLOYMENT_URL,
    environment: 'production'
  })
});
```

```python Python
import requests
import os

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.bugster.app/webhooks/integrations/custom',
    headers={
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-API-KEY': os.environ['BUGSTER_API_KEY']
    },
    json={
        'deployment_state': 'success',
        'project_id': os.environ['PROJECT_ID'],
        'organization_id': os.environ['ORG_ID'],
        'commit_sha': os.environ['GIT_COMMIT'],
        'environment_url': os.environ['DEPLOYMENT_URL'],
        'environment': 'production'
    }
)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Test the integration">
Deploy your application and verify that:
1. The webhook is called successfully
2. Bugster receives the deployment notification
3. Test runs appear in your Bugster dashboard

<Check>
You can monitor webhook calls in your Bugster dashboard under **Project Settings > Integrations**.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Environment-specific testing**: Use the `environment` parameter to run different test suites for staging vs production deployments.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Error handling**: Always check the webhook response and implement retry logic for failed requests.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Only call on success**: Set `deployment_state` to `"success"` only when your deployment is complete and accessible. Bugster cannot test broken deployments.
</Warning>

## Example Implementations

See our [GCP Cloud Build integration guide](/integrations/cloud-build) for a real-world example of using the custom integration API.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Repository does not have .bugster configuration folder">
**Error message:** `"Skipping event: Repository does not have .bugster configuration folder"`

This means your repository is missing the `.bugster` folder with test configurations. To fix this:

1. Run `bugster quickstart --api-key=YOUR_API_KEY` in your repository
2. Follow the prompts to set up your test configuration
3. Commit the generated `.bugster/` folder to your repository
4. Redeploy and trigger the webhook again

<Warning>
The `.bugster` folder must be present in the repository branch you're deploying for tests to run.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tests not running after webhook call">
- Verify `deployment_state` is set to `"success"`
- Ensure `environment_url` is accessible and returns a valid response
- Check that your API key, project ID, and organization ID are correct
- Confirm the `.bugster` configuration folder exists in your repository
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication errors">
- Confirm your API key is valid and hasn't expired
- Ensure the `X-API-KEY` header is properly formatted
- Check that your API key has the necessary permissions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Invalid project or organization">
- Verify your project ID and organization ID in the Bugster dashboard
- Ensure you're using the correct IDs for the environment you're targeting
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
