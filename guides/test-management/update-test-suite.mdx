Keep your test suite synchronized with code changes. The approach depends on your framework: Next.js and React can use the automatic `bugster update` command, while Angular, Svelte, Vue, and other frameworks use AI-assisted updates with Cursor or Claude Code.

<Info>
**Framework-specific updates**: Next.js and React use `bugster update` command with automatic routing analysis. Angular, Svelte, Vue, and other frameworks use AI assistance with Cursor or Claude Code Agent rules.
</Info>

In this guide you will learn:
- How to keep your test suite synchronized with your codebase.
- How to use different update modes for local development and CI workflows (Next.js & React).
- How to use AI-assisted updates for other frameworks (Angular, Svelte, Vue & Others).

<Card title="Prerequisites">
- Bugster CLI installed and authenticated.
- Run commands from your repo root (the directory containing `/.bugster/`).
- For Next.js & React PR automation: the Bugster GitHub App is installed on the repo (document required permissions) and PR previews are available if your flow depends on them.

## Framework-Specific Approaches

  <Tab title="Next.js & React">
    **Automatic `bugster update` Command**
    
    Next.js and React applications can use the `bugster update` command to automatically:
    - Create tests for new functionality
    - Modify tests impacted by code changes
    - Delete tests for removed features
    
    Available both locally on demand and automatically on pull requests via the GitHub App.

  <Tab title="Angular, Svelte, Vue & Others">
    **AI-Assisted Updates with Cursor or Claude Code**
    
    For Angular, Svelte, Vue, and other frameworks (including Nuxt, SvelteKit, Remix, Preact, and more), test updates are handled through AI coding assistants:
    
    - Use Cursor or Claude Code with Bugster Agent rules
    - AI assistant analyzes your code changes and updates tests accordingly
    - Provides intelligent suggestions for test modifications
    - Works with any framework or routing pattern

## Usage Modes (Next.js & React)

### Local (manual)

<Note>
**Available for:** Next.js and React applications with enhanced routing analysis.
</Note>

Run `bugster update` when you're confident about local changes and ready to sync them. The command analyzes **committed changes only** - both staged and unstaged files are ignored. Only differences between commits are considered for test updates.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Full update
# Full update (create/modify/delete as needed)
bugster update
```
```bash Scope behavior
# Only modify existing tests
bugster update --update-only

# Only create new tests
bugster update --suggest-only

# Only remove obsolete tests
bugster update --delete-only
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
**Scope flag precedence:** If multiple scope flags are provided, the command will error and ask you to specify only one scope option.
</Info>

### Automatic on Pull Requests

<Note>
**Available for:** Next.js and React applications with the Bugster GitHub App installed.
</Note>

When you open a Pull Request, Bugster's E2E agent runs `bugster update` first. New commits or force-pushes will **amend the existing Update PR** rather than creating a new one.

<Steps>
<Step title="Bugster creates an Update PR">
Bugster opens a secondary PR targeting your feature branch with the suggested test suite changes.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the results">
The original PR gets a comment with the test results and a link to the "Bugster Update PR".
</Step>
<Step title="Approve and merge">
You approve and merge the "Bugster Update PR".
</Step>
<Step title="Merge your feature">
Once the test updates are in, you can merge your feature branch.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Remember to review the Bugster Update PR **before** merging your feature.
</Warning>

Here is a summary of the flow:
```text
You create a PR  →  bugster update runs  →  Bugster opens "Update PR" → 
Bugster comments results in original PR → you review/merge Update PR → merge feature PR
```

## Comparison Baselines (Next.js & React)

Choose the comparison model that fits your development stage:

| Baseline | Use When | Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Last commit (default) | Small, isolated edits | `bugster update` |
| Default branch | Before PR / comprehensive sweep | `bugster update --against-default` |
| Since last update | Tight inner loop without reprocessing | `bugster update --against-last-update` |

### Last commit (default)
*When to use: Small, isolated edits*

```bash
bugster update
```
**Scope:** Compares your latest commit against the previous commit. Only sees files changed in your most recent commit.

### Against default branch  
*When to use: Before PR / comprehensive sweep*

```bash
bugster update --against-default
```
**Scope:** Compares your current branch against the merge-base with the default branch (e.g., `main`). Sees all changes in your feature branch.

### Since last update
*When to use: Tight inner loop without reprocessing*

```bash
bugster update --against-last-update
```
**Scope:** Compares changes since the last time you ran `bugster update`. The "last update" state is stored in `.bugster/state/last-update-hash` and tracks the commit hash from your previous update.

## Recommended Workflow (Next.js & React)

| Scenario | Command | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| During active development | `bugster update --against-last-update` | Tight feedback loop |
| Before opening a PR | `bugster update --against-default` | Final, comprehensive sweep |
| For small, isolated edits | `bugster update` | Default mode usually sufficient |

## Workflow for Other Frameworks

For Angular, Svelte, Vue, and other frameworks:

| Scenario | Approach | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Test updates needed | Use Cursor or Claude Code with Bugster Agent rules | AI-assisted test updates based on code changes |
| Review and refine | AI coding assistant + manual review | Ensure tests match your changes |
| Commit test changes | Standard git workflow | Keep tests in sync with code |

## Examples (Next.js & React)

Here are common scenarios and the commands to use for Next.js and React applications.

## Review Tips

<Tip>
**For Next.js & React:**
- Always review the Update PR diff before merging.
- Keep descriptive commit messages (e.g., `bugster: update tests for billing portal flow`).
- If a change looks incorrect, adjust the code or the test, rerun `bugster update`, and re-review.

**For Angular, Svelte, Vue & Others:**
- Review AI-generated test updates in your coding assistant.
- Ensure tests accurately reflect your code changes.
- Commit test updates alongside your feature changes.
</Tip>

## Summary

**Next.js & React**: Use the `bugster update` command to keep your test suite aligned with code changes—locally or automatically on every PR.

**Angular, Svelte, Vue & Others**: Use AI-assisted updates with Cursor or Claude Code Agent rules for intelligent test synchronization.
