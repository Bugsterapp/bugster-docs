<Tip>
In this guide you will learn:
- How to keep your test suite synchronized with your codebase using `bugster update`.
- How to use different update modes for local development and CI workflows.
- How to compare changes against different baselines like the default branch or the last update.
</Tip>

<Info>
**Goal:** Keep your test suite current as features evolve—create, modify, and remove tests with a single command.
</Info>

## TL;DR

Run the following command to automatically update your test suite:

```bash
bugster update
```

This command will:
- **Create** tests for new functionality.
- **Modify** tests impacted by code changes.
- **Delete** tests for removed features.

You can use it locally on demand or automatically on every pull request via the GitHub App.

## Usage Modes

### Local (manual)

Run `bugster update` when you're confident about local changes and ready to sync them.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Full update
# Full update (create/modify/delete as needed)
bugster update
```
```bash Scope behavior
# Only modify existing tests
bugster update --update-only

# Only create new tests
bugster update --suggest-only

# Only remove obsolete tests
bugster update --delete-only
```
</CodeGroup>

### Automatic on Pull Requests

When you open a Pull Request, Bugster's E2E agent runs `bugster update` first.

<Steps>
<Step title="Bugster creates an Update PR">
Bugster opens a secondary PR targeting your feature branch with the suggested test suite changes.
</Step>
<Step title="Review the results">
The original PR gets a comment with the test results and a link to the "Bugster Update PR".
</Step>
<Step title="Approve and merge">
You approve and merge the "Bugster Update PR".
</Step>
<Step title="Merge your feature">
Once the test updates are in, you can merge your feature branch.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Remember to review the Bugster Update PR **before** merging your feature.
</Warning>

Here is a summary of the flow:
```text
dev creates PR  →  bugster update runs  →  Bugster opens "Update PR" → 
Bugster comments results in original PR → you review/merge Update PR → merge feature PR
```

## Comparison Baselines

Choose the comparison model that fits your development stage.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Default: Compare against last commit">
```bash
bugster update
```
Compares your local changes against the last commit. It only sees files you've changed, added, or deleted since your last commit.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Against default branch">
```bash
bugster update --against-default
```
Compares your current branch against the default branch (e.g., `main`). It sees all changes in your feature branch.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Incremental since last update">
```bash
bugster update --against-last-update
```
Compares changes from the last time you ran `bugster update` to now. It only sees new changes since the previous update.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Recommended Workflow

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="During active development">
Use `--against-last-update` for a tight feedback loop.
```bash
bugster update --against-last-update
```
</Card>
<Card title="Before opening a PR">
Use `--against-default` for a final, comprehensive sweep.
```bash
bugster update --against-default
```
</Card>
<Card title="For small, isolated edits">
The default mode is usually sufficient.
```bash
bugster update
```
</Card>
</CardGroup>


## Examples

Here are common scenarios and the commands to use.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Default update for recently touched files">
```bash
# Create/modify/delete as needed for just-touched files
bugster update
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Full branch comparison before creating a PR">
```bash
# Full branch comparison before PR
bugster update --against-default
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tight inner loop without reprocessing old changes">
```bash
# Tight inner loop; don’t reprocess old changes
bugster update --against-last-update
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Limit to modifications only (no new/deleted tests)">
```bash
# Limit to modifications only (no new/deleted tests)
bugster update --update-only
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generate suggestions for new areas only">
```bash
# Generate suggestions for new areas only
bugster update --suggest-only
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Purge tests tied to removed features">
```bash
# Purge tests tied to removed features
bugster update --delete-only
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Combine scope and baseline">
```bash
# Combine scope + baseline
bugster update --against-default --update-only
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Review Tips

<Tip>
- Always review the Update PR diff before merging.
- Keep descriptive commit messages (e.g., `bugster: update tests for billing portal flow`).
- If a change looks incorrect, adjust the code or the test, rerun `bugster update`, and re-review.
</Tip>

That’s it: one standardized command keeps your suite aligned with real product changes—locally or automatically on every PR.
