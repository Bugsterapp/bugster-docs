## 1. How to generate tests

Bugster supports **three** creation modes:

1.  **Automatic bulk generation** → `bugster generate`
2.  **Manual** → write a **YAML test** using the template and place it in the tests folder
3.  **Assisted** → author/edit YAML with Claude Code or Cursor *(“View guide”)*

<Note>
Note: Replace example paths with ones from your repo.
</Note>

### 1.1 Automatic (bulk) — `bugster generate`

Bugster can **propose and create** many tests across your app or for specific pages.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Bulk auto-generation (across some pages)
bugster generate

# Generate for specific pages
bugster generate --page path/to/page.tsx path/to/another/page.tsx

# Generate N tests distributed across pages
bugster generate --count 10

# Combine: 13 tests for a specific page
bugster generate --count 13 --page path/to/page.tsx
```

- **Pros:** fast, broad initial coverage, zero overhead.
- **Cons:** if you need a **very specific** use case, it might not appear on the first pass (complement with a manual test).

### 1.2 Manual (YAML template)

For **precise** scenarios, create your own test explicitly.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Content:** follow the **YAML morphology** (see next section).
2.  **File:** place it under the Bugster tests folder, mirroring your app’s **filesystem hierarchy**.

**Suggested template (copy/paste):**

```yaml
name: User details page navigation
page: /dashboard/users
page_path: app/dashboard/users/page.tsx
task: Navigate from users list to a specific user's details page
steps:
- Navigate to the dashboard users page
- Click on a specific user from the list
- Verify that the user is redirected to the user details page
- Verify that the user details are displayed correctly
expected_result: User should be redirected to the specific user's details page
```

**Run your manual test to validate it:**

```bash
bugster run relative_path_to_my_test.yaml
```

### 1.3 Assisted (Claude Code / Cursor)

Use  Claude Code or  Cursor to **draft** and **refine** the YAML with prompts and inline edits. *(“View guide”)*

## 2. Test morphology in Bugster

> Definition: the minimal structure Bugster expects in a test.

```yaml
name: Title of the test
page: Main page path of the test in /folder/subfolder format, e.g. "/dashboard/users"
page_path: Source path of the page, e.g. app/dashboard/users/page.tsx
task: The goal the test must achieve
steps:
- General or specific steps
- What you want the agent to do to achieve the task
- Because there can be multiple paths to the same goal
expected_result: What the agent should verify to confirm the goal was achieved
```

**Example:**

```yaml
name: User details page navigation
page: /dashboard/users
page_path: app/dashboard/users/page.tsx
task: Navigate from users list to a specific user's details page
steps:
- Navigate to the dashboard users page
- Click on a specific user from the list
- Verify that the user is redirected to the user details page
- Verify that the user details are displayed correctly
expected_result: User should be redirected to the specific user's details page
```

## 3. Editing an existing test

You can **edit** any Bugster-generated (or user-created) test, as long as you keep the YAML **morphology** (`name`, `page`, `page_path`, `task`, `steps`, `expected_result`).

- Rename the **test** for team clarity.
- Adjust the **task** to be more precise.
- Add/remove **steps** to better guide the agent.
- Update the **expected_result** if the verification changes.

**Before/after example:**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Old">
```yaml
name: User details page navigation
page: /dashboard/users
page_path: app/dashboard/users/page.tsx
task: Navigate from users list to a specific user's details page
steps:
- Navigate to the dashboard users page
- Click on a specific user from the list
- Verify that the user is redirected to the user details page
- Verify that the user details are displayed correctly
expected_result: User should be redirected to the specific user's details page
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="New">
```yaml
name: User details view
page: /dashboard/users
page_path: app/dashboard/users/page.tsx
task: Navigate from users list to any user's details page
steps:
- Navigate to the dashboard users page
- Click on any user from the list
- Verify that the user is redirected to the user details page
expected_result: User should be redirected to any user's details page
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Recommendation: run the test again to confirm the changes are honored:
```bash
bugster run relative_path_to_my_test.yaml
```
</Tip>

## 4. Deleting tests

You can **delete** any test with no restrictions:

- **Single file:** remove the test file.
- **Batch:** delete a **folder** under `.bugster/tests/...` to remove all tests beneath it.

<Info>
This does not disrupt Bugster’s functionality or your workflows.
</Info>

## 5. File location and naming conventions

- Bugster tests folder: `/.bugster/tests/`
- **Hierarchy:** mirror your app structure (based on `page_path`).

**Mapping example:**

If your test declares `page_path: app/dashboard/users/page.tsx`, the recommended location is:

```
.bugster/tests/dashboard/users/test.yaml
```

**File naming:**

- use **snake_case**, lowercase, descriptive.
- If `name: Navigation back to home from about page`, the recommended file name is:
    
    ```
    navigation_back_to_home_from_about_page.yaml
    ```
