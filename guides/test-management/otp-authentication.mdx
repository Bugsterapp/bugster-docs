Bugster authenticates to your app like a real user to run tests. Besides [username/password](/guides/test-management/credentials-and-roles), Bugster supports **OTP (One-Time Password)**—temporary codes sent via email during login.

<Info>
Bugster provides a managed email address with access to incoming OTPs. You create an account in your app using this email.
</Info>

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Get your Bugster OTP email">
  Contact Bugster support or check your dashboard to obtain your dedicated OTP email address.
</Step>

<Step title="Create an account in your app">
  Register a new user in your application using the Bugster OTP email.
</Step>

<Step title="Add OTP credential to config.yaml">

```yaml
credentials:
  - id: otp-user
    email: ${BUGSTER_OTP_EMAIL}
    auth_type: otp
```

</Step>

<Step title="Set the environment variable">

```bash
# .bugster/.env
BUGSTER_OTP_EMAIL=your.bugster.email@...
```

</Step>

<Step title="(Optional) Add to CI/CD">
  If using CI/CD, go to **Projects → Settings → Environment Variables** and add:
  
  ```
  BUGSTER_OTP_EMAIL=your.bugster.email@...
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Use OTP in tests

Add these fields to any test requiring OTP authentication:

```yaml
name: Dashboard access
page: /dashboard
credential_id: otp-user
requires_login: true
task: Verify dashboard loads after OTP login
steps:
  - Navigate to dashboard
  - Verify content is displayed
expected_result: Dashboard renders successfully
```

<Note>
All tests with the same `credential_id` and `requires_login: true` share one authenticated session. Bugster logs in once, then reuses the session for subsequent tests. See [Session Persistence](/guides/test-management/session-persistence) for details.
</Note>
