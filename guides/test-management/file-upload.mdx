This guide explains how to enable file uploads during test runs. Bugster can upload any type of file to your application during a test. See use cases below for examples.

**The workflow is simple**: upload the files you want Bugster to use during the test, tell Bugster which file you want to use, and you're ready to go.


## Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Upload files in File Management">
Go to your project in the Bugster App → Settings → File Management and upload your test files.


Upload any files you want to use during testing. Supported formats include documents, images, code files, etc.
</Step>

<Step title="Add files to your test YAML">
Add the `files:` field at the root level of your test and list the exact filenames as they appear in the File Management section.

```yaml
name: Upload file attachment
page: /upload
files:
  - sample.csv
task: Upload a CSV file through the file picker
steps:
  - Navigate to the upload page
  - Click the "Choose File" button
  - Select a file to upload
  - Verify "sample.csv" appears in the file list
expected_result: File is successfully attached and visible in the UI
```

<Warning>
File names are case-sensitive and must match exactly as they appear in the File Management section.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Run your test">
Execute your test normally. Bugster automatically handles file attachment during test execution.

```bash
bugster run .bugster/tests/upload-test.yaml
```

<Check>
Bugster will automatically attach the specified file to any file picker in your UI during the test.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## File management

All test files are stored in the Bugster App under Project → Settings → File Management. This centralized approach ensures:

- **Universal availability**: Files work in local development and CI/CD
- **Team collaboration**: Shared access across team members  
- **Secure storage**: Files are stored securely with direct URL access
- **Easy management**: Upload, view, and delete files through the web interface

<Info>
Files uploaded to the File Management are automatically available for all test environments without additional configuration.
</Info>

## Test examples

### Single file upload

Test uploading a single file through a file picker:

```yaml
name: Document upload via file picker
page: /documents
files:
  - contract.pdf
task: Upload a PDF document using the file picker
steps:
  - Navigate to the documents page
  - Click the "Upload Document" button
  - Select a file from the picker
  - Wait for upload progress to complete
  - Verify "contract.pdf" appears in the document list
expected_result: Document is successfully uploaded and listed
```

### Multiple file upload

Test uploading multiple files simultaneously:

```yaml
name: Bulk file upload
page: /gallery
files:
  - photo1.jpg
  - photo2.jpg
  - photo3.jpg
task: Upload multiple images to gallery
steps:
  - Navigate to the gallery page
  - Click "Add Photos" button
  - Select multiple files for upload
  - Verify all three images appear in the upload queue
  - Wait for batch upload to complete
expected_result: All three photos are successfully added to the gallery
```

### Image upload with preview

Test image uploads that show preview functionality:

```yaml
name: Profile picture upload
page: /profile
files:
  - avatar.png
task: Upload and preview profile picture
steps:
  - Navigate to the profile page
  - Click "Change Avatar" button
  - Select "avatar.png" from the file picker
  - Wait for the upload to process
  - Verify the image preview is displayed
expected_result: New avatar is shown in the profile section
```

## File naming and organization

<Info>
File references in YAML are case-sensitive and must include the file extension.
</Info>

### Naming best practices

- Use descriptive names: `user-avatar.png` instead of `img1.png`
- Include file extensions: `data.csv`, `report.pdf`
- Avoid spaces and special characters: use hyphens or underscores
- Keep names concise but meaningful

<Tip>
Use the exact filename as it appears in the Bugster App File Management interface.
</Tip>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="File selection and preparation">
- **Use synthetic data**: Never include real user data or PII in test files
- **Keep files lightweight**: Use small files for faster test execution
- **Test edge cases**: Include files with different formats, sizes, and names
- **Upload to File Management**: All files must be uploaded through the web interface
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test design">
- **Verify upload states**: Test loading indicators and progress bars
- **Check error handling**: Test with invalid file types or oversized files
- **Validate UI feedback**: Ensure success messages and file lists update correctly
- **Test accessibility**: Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader support
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="File management">
- **Centralized storage**: All files are managed through File Management interface
- **Team sharing**: Files are accessible to all team members
- **Clean up regularly**: Remove unused files to keep storage organized
- **Use Copy YAML**: Leverage the copy button for accurate file references
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues and solutions

<Tabs>
<Tab title="File not found">
**Problem:** Test fails with "file not found" error.

**Solution:**
1. Verify the file is uploaded in Bugster App → Project → Settings → File Management
2. Check the filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Ensure the file extension is included in the YAML reference

```yaml
files:
  - sample.csv  # ✅ Correct: includes extension
  - sample      # ❌ Wrong: missing extension
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="File picker not opening">
**Problem:** Clicking the upload button doesn't open the file picker.

**Solution:**
1. Verify user authentication and permissions
2. Check that any required form fields are completed
3. Ensure the UI is in the correct state for file uploads
4. Look for disabled states or loading conditions

```yaml
steps:
  - Log in with valid credentials
  - Navigate to the upload page
  - Fill in required form fields
  - Click the "Choose File" button
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Wrong file selected">
**Problem:** Test selects a different file than expected.

**Solution:**
1. Use the "Copy YAML" button in the File Management for exact filename
2. Verify no duplicate filenames exist in your file storage
3. Check that the filename in YAML matches the uploaded file exactly

```yaml
files:
  - Frame1410087848.png  # ✅ Exact filename from File Management
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced scenarios

### Testing file validation

Test your application's file validation logic:

```yaml
name: File type validation
page: /upload
files:
  - invalid.txt
  - valid-image.jpg
task: Test file type validation
steps:
  - Navigate to upload page
  - Attempt to upload "invalid.txt"
  - Verify error message appears
  - Upload "valid-image.jpg"
  - Verify successful upload
expected_result: Invalid files are rejected with clear error messages
```

### Testing file size limits

```yaml
name: File size limit validation
page: /upload
files:
  - large-file.pdf
task: Test file size restrictions
steps:
  - Navigate to upload page
  - Attempt to upload "large-file.pdf"
  - Verify size limit error message
  - Check that upload is prevented
expected_result: Large files are rejected with appropriate error message
```
