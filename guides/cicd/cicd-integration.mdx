Bugster integrates seamlessly with your CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests against preview deployments on every pull request. This ensures your application works correctly before merging changes.

<Info>
Currently supported deployment platforms: **Vercel**, **Railway**, and **Netlify**.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up CI/CD integration, ensure you have:
- A Bugster organization and project configured
- A GitHub repository with your application code
- Your application deployed on Vercel, Railway, or Netlify
- Admin access to your GitHub repository and deployment platform project

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Install GitHub App">
  Install the Bugster GitHub App in your organization to enable repository access and pull request integration.
  
  1. Navigate to your Bugster organization settings
  2. Go to **Integrations** → **GitHub**
  3. Click **Install GitHub App**
  4. Select your organization and repositories
  5. Complete the installation process
  
  <Check>
  Verify the GitHub App appears in your organization's installed apps.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Integrate GitHub Repository">
  Connect your GitHub repository to your Bugster project to enable automated test execution.
  
  1. In your Bugster project dashboard, go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
  2. Click **Connect Repository**
  3. Select your GitHub repository from the list
  4. Confirm the integration
  
  <Warning>
  Ensure the GitHub repository matches the one where you installed the Bugster GitHub App.
  </Warning>

<Step title="Configure Platform Integration">
  Set up your deployment platform integration based on where your application is hosted:
  
  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Vercel" icon="triangle">
    Enable Bugster to access your Vercel preview deployments using Protection Bypass:
    
    1. In Vercel, navigate to your project's [Deployment Protection settings](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fdeployment-protection&title=Deployment+Protection+settings)
    2. Navigate to **Protection Bypass for Automation**
    3. Click **Add Secret** to generate a bypass token
    4. Copy the generated secret
    5. In Bugster, go to **Project Settings** → **Config YAML**
    6. Add the secret to your configuration:
    
    ```yaml
    vercel:
      protection_bypass: "your-generated-secret-here"

    Configure Netlify webhook notifications for deployment events:
    
    1. In Netlify, go to your project **Settings** → **Notifications > Emails and Webhooks**
    2. Add HTTP POST request notifications for:
       - Deploy succeed
       - Deploy started  
       - Deploy failed
    3. Get the webhook URL from Bugster Project Settings → Integrations → Netlify Integration
    4. Add the webhook URL to each notification type
