Bugster integrates seamlessly with your CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests against preview deployments on every pull request. This ensures your application works correctly before merging changes.

<Info>
Currently supported deployment platforms: **Vercel** and **Railway**. More platforms coming soon.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up CI/CD integration, ensure you have:
- A Bugster organization and project configured
- A GitHub repository with your application code
- Your application deployed on Vercel or Railway
- Admin access to your GitHub repository and Vercel/Railway project

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Install GitHub App">
  Install the Bugster GitHub App in your organization to enable repository access and pull request integration.
  
  1. Navigate to your Bugster organization settings
  2. Go to **Integrations** → **GitHub**
  3. Click **Install GitHub App**
  4. Select your organization and repositories
  5. Complete the installation process
  
  <Check>
  Verify the GitHub App appears in your organization's installed apps.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Integrate GitHub Repository">
  Connect your GitHub repository to your Bugster project to enable automated test execution.
  
  1. In your Bugster project dashboard, go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
  2. Click **Connect Repository**
  3. Select your GitHub repository from the list
  4. Confirm the integration
  
  <Warning>
  Ensure the GitHub repository matches the one where you installed the Bugster GitHub App.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Vercel Preview Access">
  Enable Bugster to access your Vercel preview deployments using one of two methods:
  
  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Protection Bypass (Recommended)">
    Create a protection bypass secret for automated access while maintaining security.
    
    1. In Vercel, navigate to your project's [Deployment Protection settings](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fdeployment-protection&title=Deployment+Protection+settings)
    2. Navigate to **Protection Bypass for Automation**
    3. Click **Add Secret** to generate a bypass token
    4. Copy the generated secret
    5. In Bugster, go to **Project Settings** → **Config YAML**
    6. Add the secret to your configuration:
    
    ```yaml
    vercel:
      protection_bypass: "your-generated-secret-here"
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    This method maintains Vercel's authentication while allowing Bugster automated access.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Disable Vercel Auth">
    Temporarily disable Vercel authentication for preview deployments.
    
    1. In Vercel, go to your project **Settings** → **Functions**
    2. Find **Vercel Authentication** 
    3. Set to **Disabled**
    4. Save changes
    
    <Warning>
    This method disables authentication entirely and is less secure than using Protection Bypass.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Step>

<Step title="Test the Integration">
  Verify everything works by creating a test pull request.
  
  1. Create a new branch in your repository
  2. Make a small change to your application
  3. Open a pull request
  4. Wait for Bugster to automatically run tests
  5. Check the PR for Bugster results and status updates
  
  <Check>
  You should see Bugster test results appear as a check in your pull request within a few minutes.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Configuration

### Organization Preferences

Configure how Bugster behaves across your organization and projects:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Destructive Agent Settings">
  Control whether Bugster's destructive agent runs on pull requests:
  
  1. Go to **Organization Settings** → **General**
  2. Find **Bugster Destructive** option
  3. Toggle to enable/disable destructive testing on PRs
  
  <Info>
  The destructive agent tests edge cases and error scenarios that might break your application.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Execution Frequency">
  Choose when Bugster runs tests on your pull requests:
  
  **Available options:**
  - **On every commit** (default): Runs tests each time you push changes
  - **Once per PR**: Runs tests only when the PR is first opened
  
  Configure in **Organization Settings** → **General** → **Run on Every PR Deployment**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Environment Selection">
  Select which environments Bugster should test:
  
  1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** → **General**
  2. Find **Run on Environments**
  3. Choose from:
     - Production only
     - Preview only  
     - Both environments
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Email Notifications

Get notified when tests fail in your deployments:

1. Go to **Organization Settings** → **General**
2. Enable **Send Email Alerts for Failed Tests**
3. Configure recipient preferences

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Bugster not running on PRs">
  **Possible causes:**
  - GitHub App not installed or missing repository permissions
  - Repository not connected to Bugster project
  - Vercel preview access not configured properly
  
  **Solutions:**
  - Verify GitHub App installation and permissions
  - Re-connect repository in project settings
  - Check Vercel protection bypass configuration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tests failing to access preview URL">
  **Possible causes:**
  - Vercel authentication blocking access
  - Invalid protection bypass secret
  - Preview deployment not ready
  
  **Solutions:**
  - Verify protection bypass secret is correct
  - Check Vercel deployment status
  - Ensure preview URL is accessible
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No test results in PR">
  **Possible causes:**
  - Tests not configured in Bugster project
  - Test generation failed
  - CI/CD pipeline issues
  
  **Solutions:**
  - Verify tests exist in your Bugster project
  - Check Bugster logs for errors
  - Review GitHub Actions/deployment logs
</Accordion>
