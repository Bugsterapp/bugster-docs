Run AI-powered destructive agents like `form_destroyer` and `ui_crasher` to find potential bugs in your recent code changes by attempting to break your application.

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Run destructive agents on all changed pages
bugster destructive

# Run in headless mode for faster execution
bugster destructive --headless

# Limit number of agents (default: 5)
bugster destructive --limit 10
```

## Common Scenarios

### After Feature Development

You just built a new checkout flow and want to stress-test it:

```bash
# Run destructive testing with moderate scope
bugster destructive --limit 8

# Run multiple agents in parallel for speed
bugster destructive --max-concurrent 5
```

### Pre-Release Testing

Before deploying, run comprehensive destructive testing:

```bash
# Extended testing session
bugster destructive --limit 15 --verbose

# Export results for review
bugster destructive --output destructive-results.json
```

<Note>
Destructive testing is most effective when combined with regular testing. Use it to discover edge cases that traditional tests might miss.
