Transform Cursor into a Bugster expert that can both generate comprehensive test specifications and automatically validate your UI changes as you build.

## Two Cursor Use Cases for Bugster

Bugster provides two specialized Cursor rules to enhance your development workflow:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Test Generation" icon="file-lines" href="#test-generation-rule">
**Manual activation** - Generate comprehensive test specifications following Bugster's YAML structure and best practices.
</Card>

<Card title="Quick Validation" icon="bolt" href="#quick-test-rule">
**Auto-activation** - Automatically validate UI changes after modifying components or pages with a final E2E test.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

| Rule | When to Use | Activation | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Test Generation** | Building test suites | Manual (`@bugster-test-rules`) | Create comprehensive test specifications |
| **Quick Validation** | After UI changes | Automatic (on file save) | Validate implementation meets requirements |

## Using Cursor with Bugster

Cursor rules provide persistent context about your Bugster project, ensuring consistent test generation and automatic validation that follows your standards and best practices.

* **Project rules** are stored in your repository and shared with your team.
* **User rules** apply to your personal Cursor environment.

We recommend creating project rules for your Bugster project so that all contributors generate tests following the same standards.

Create rules files in the `.cursor/rules` directory of your project. See the [Cursor Rules documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) for complete setup instructions.

## Test Generation Rule

This rule provides Cursor with context to properly generate Bugster test specifications following the required YAML structure and best practices.

<Info>
**File name suggestion:** `bugster-test-generation.mdc`
</Info>

Add this rule as a `.mdc` file in the `.cursor/rules` directory of your project:

````mdx
---
alwaysApply: false

# Bugster Test Generation Rules

When creating Bugster test specifications, follow these strict requirements:

## YAML Structure (Non-negotiable)

```yaml
name: Descriptive test name
page: /route/path
page_path: relative/file/path.tsx # always relative to the frontend project (e.g., app/route.tsx); do not include a monorepo prefix like 'frontend/'
task: Clear test objective
steps:
  - Action 1
  - Action 2
  - Verification step
expected_result: Success criteria
```

**All fields are required. No exceptions.**

## page_path Requirements

- Must be the **relative path** to the actual page file being tested
- Examples:
  - `app/dashboard/users/page.tsx` (App Router)
  - `pages/auth/login.tsx` (Pages Router)  
  - `src/pages/products/[id].tsx` (Dynamic route)

## File Naming & Location

### File naming: snake_case, descriptive, .yaml extension
- ✅ `user_profile_edit_form.yaml`
- ✅ `login_authentication_flow.yaml`
- ❌ `userProfile.yaml` (camelCase)
- ❌ `test1.yaml` (not descriptive)

### File location: Mirror your app's filesystem hierarchy
```
# If page_path: app/dashboard/users/page.tsx
# Save to: .bugster/tests/dashboard/users/user_list_navigation.yaml

# If page_path: pages/auth/login.tsx
# Save to: .bugster/tests/auth/login_form_validation.yaml

# If page_path: src/components/profile/settings.tsx
# Save to: .bugster/tests/profile/settings_panel_functionality.yaml
```

## Test Generation Limits

**Before creating new tests:**
- Check existing tests in `.bugster/tests/` to avoid duplicates
- Review similar functionality that may already be covered
- Only create tests for uncovered scenarios

**Maximum 5 tests per feature** (unless user explicitly requests more)
- Focus on core functionality first
- Avoid repetitive test scenarios
- Quality over quantity - one comprehensive test is better than multiple redundant ones
- Stop early if core functionality is already covered

## Quick Reference

**Always provide:**
1. Complete YAML with all required fields
2. Correct relative page_path 
3. Proper snake_case filename suggestion
4. Full file path under `.bugster/tests/`

**Never:**
- Skip required fields
- Use absolute paths in page_path
- Suggest camelCase or space-separated filenames
- Place files outside `.bugster/tests/` hierarchy
- Generate more than 5 tests per feature without explicit request
````

## How to Use the Rule

<Warning>
This rule is set to `alwaysApply: false`, meaning it only activates when explicitly tagged in your Cursor chat.
</Warning>

### Manual Activation

To use the Bugster test generation rule, mention it explicitly in your Cursor chat:

<CodeGroup>
```text Basic Usage
@bugster-test-rules Generate a test for the user login page
```

```text Specific Feature
@bugster-test-rules Create tests for the shopping cart checkout flow
```

```text Multiple Tests
@bugster-test-rules Generate 3 tests for the dashboard analytics page
```
</CodeGroup>

### Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Explicit Requests" icon="tag">
Always tag the rule when you want Bugster-compliant test generation.
</Card>

<Card title="Check Existing Tests" icon="magnifying-glass">
Review `.bugster/tests/` before generating new tests to avoid duplicates.
</Card>

<Card title="Quality Focus" icon="star">
Request comprehensive tests rather than many simple ones.
</Card>

<Card title="File Structure" icon="folder">
Ensure generated tests follow your app's hierarchy in `.bugster/tests/`.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Example Generated Test

When using the rule, Cursor will generate tests following this structure:

```yaml
name: User login authentication flow
page: /auth/login
page_path: app/auth/login/page.tsx
task: Authenticate user with valid credentials and redirect to dashboard
steps:
  - Navigate to the login page
  - Fill in email field with valid email
  - Fill in password field with valid password
  - Click the login button
  - Verify redirect to dashboard occurs
  - Verify user session is established
expected_result: User should be successfully authenticated and redirected to the dashboard with an active session
```

## Rule Customization

You can customize the rule for your specific project needs:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Framework-Specific">
Modify the `page_path` examples to match your framework:
- Next.js App Router: `app/route/page.tsx`
- Next.js Pages Router: `pages/route.tsx`
- React Router: `src/pages/route.tsx`
</Tab>

<Tab title="Monorepo Structure">
Adjust path requirements for monorepo setups:
```yaml
# Example for frontend subdirectory
page_path: src/pages/dashboard.tsx # not frontend/src/pages/dashboard.tsx
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Test Limits">
Modify the maximum test limits based on your project size:
```markdown
**Maximum 10 tests per feature** (for large applications)
**Maximum 3 tests per feature** (for smaller projects)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Rule not activating">
- Ensure you're tagging the rule with `@bugster-test-rules`
- Check that the rule file is saved in `.cursor/rules/`
- Verify the rule has the correct `.mdc` extension
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Wrong file paths generated">
- Review your project structure and update the rule examples
- Ensure `page_path` examples match your framework conventions
- Check that generated paths are relative, not absolute
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Too many tests generated">
- The rule limits to 5 tests by default
- Be more specific in your request to generate fewer tests
- Review existing tests before requesting new ones
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Test Rule

This rule automatically validates your UI changes by running a comprehensive E2E test after you modify components or pages. It helps ensure your implementation meets user requirements.

<Info>
**File name suggestion:** `bugster-quick-test.mdc`
</Info>

<Warning>
E2E tests are slow (30-300 seconds). This rule is designed to run sparingly - only as final verification after code changes.
</Warning>

Add this rule as a `.mdc` file in the `.cursor/rules` directory of your project:

````mdx
---
alwaysApply: true
description: Auto-validate UI changes with quick test after modifying components or pages
globs:
  - "**/*.tsx"
  - "**/*.jsx" 
  - "**/page.tsx"
  - "**/page.jsx"
---
# Bugster Quick Test Rules

## Context
Bugster is an E2E testing agent that executes UI tests in browsers. Tests are slow (30-300 seconds), so use sparingly.

## Use Case
**Validate from the UI that generated code respects user requirements** - use as final verification step after code generation.

## Auto-Trigger Behavior
**This rule should AUTOMATICALLY activate when:**
- Creating new UI components
- Modifying existing React components  
- Implementing user-facing features
- Making changes to pages or layouts

## When to Use
- **Only once at the end** of code generation process
- At the end of every change in the UI
- After implementing features that affect UI behavior
- To verify multiple aspects in a single comprehensive test
- **Never abuse** - execution takes up to 5 minutes

## Command Format
Always use these flags:

```bash
bugster run --prompt "{comprehensive validation description}" --silent --headless --output quick_validation.json
```

Add `--base-url http://localhost:PORT` if you opened the app in a new terminal.

## Prompt Guidelines
- **Be comprehensive** - validate multiple points in one test since you only get one shot
- Focus on core functionality the user requested
- Include key user flows and expected behaviors
- Mention specific UI elements or interactions to verify

## Example
```bash
bugster run --prompt "Test the new user registration form - verify all fields accept input, form submits successfully, validation works for empty fields, and user gets redirected to dashboard after signup" --silent --headless --base-url http://localhost:3000 --output quick_validation.json
```

## Rules
- **Maximum 1 execution per code generation session**
- Always include `--silent --headless --output quick_validation.json`
- Pack multiple validations into single comprehensive prompt
- Use only as final verification step
````

## Combining Both Rules

For optimal workflow, use both rules together:

<Steps>
<Step title="Setup">
Add both rule files to your `.cursor/rules` directory:
- `bugster-test-generation.mdc` (manual activation)
- `bugster-quick-test.mdc` (auto-activation)
</Step>

<Step title="Development Flow">
1. Build your feature as requested
2. **Quick Test rule** automatically validates the implementation
3. Use **Test Generation rule** when you need comprehensive test suites
</Step>

<Step title="Team Consistency">
Both rules ensure all team members follow the same Bugster standards and validation processes.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Start with the default rules and customize them as you learn your team's testing patterns and preferences. The rules help maintain consistency across all contributors to your Bugster project.
