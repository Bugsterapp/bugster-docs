<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Bugster CLI">
  First, install the Bugster CLI on your system.

  Visit our installation guide for detailed setup instructions
</Card>
  </Step>

<Step title="Initialize Bugster and Generate Tests">
Navigate to your project's root directory and run the quickstart command:
```bash
cd your-project
bugster quickstart --api-key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Get your API KEY from the [Bugster Dashboard](https://app.bugster.dev).

**What this command does:**
- Sets up Bugster configuration for your project
- Creates necessary files and folders
- Analyzes your codebase and automatically generates test specifications
- Stores tests in `.bugster/tests` directory

**Configuration Prompts:**

During setup, you'll be prompted for:
- **Application URL**: The localhost URL where your frontend application runs (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`)

<Tip>
  The quickstart command combines initialization and test generation in a single step, making setup faster and simpler.

</Step>
<Step title="Run Your Tests">
Execute the generated tests against your application:

```bash
bugster run
```
This command executes your test specifications in a browser, validating the instructions in the test specification.

<Tip>
  Make sure your application is running on the configured base URL before running tests.
