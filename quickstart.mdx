## Manual Integration
For users who prefer CLI control or need custom configurations, follow this manual setup process.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Bugster CLI">
  First, install the Bugster CLI on your system.
<Card title="Install Bugster CLI" icon="download" href="/installation">
  Visit our installation guide for detailed setup instructions
</Card>
  </Step>

<Step title="Initialize Bugster in Your Project">
Navigate to your project's root directory and initialize Bugster:
```bash
cd your-nextjs-project
bugster init
```
This command sets up Bugster configuration for your specific project, creating the necessary files and folders to store your tests and settings.

**Configuration Setup** 

During initialization, you'll be prompted for:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bugster API KEY" icon="fingerprint">
    Get your API KEY from the [Bugster Dashboard](https://gui.bugster.dev).
**This is a one-time configuration per project**
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Project Name" icon="tag">
    **Recommendation**: Use your GitHub repository name for consistency
```
Project name: my-awesome-app
```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Base URL" icon="globe">
    The localhost URL where your frontend application runs
```
Application URL: http://localhost:3000
```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bypass Protection" icon="shield">
    Configure bypass protection for preview deployments (required for Vercel/Railway).
<Card title="Vercel Bypass Setup" icon="shield" href="/howto/vercel">

</Card>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Credentials" icon="key">
    **Required if your app has authentication**
Add testing credentials for Bugster to log in and test your protected pages:

- **Username/Email**: test user credentials
- **Password**: test user password

<Card title="Learn More About Project Initialization" icon="fingerprint" href="/commands/init">
  Visit our `init` guide for advanced options and customization
</Card>

</Step>

<Step title="Generate Your First Tests">
Create test specifications for your application using:

```bash
bugster generate
```
This command **analyzes your codebase and automatically creates test specifications under each page**. It understands your application structure and generates relevant test cases.

<Card title="Learn More About Test Generation" icon="sparkles" href="/commands/generate">
  Visit our generate guide for advanced options and customization
</Card>
</Step>
<Step title="Generate Your First Tests">
Execute the generated tests against your application:

```bash
bugster run
```
This command executes your test specifications in a browser, validating the instructions in the test specification.

<Tip>
  Make sure your application is running on the configured base URL before running tests.
